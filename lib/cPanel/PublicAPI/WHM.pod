=head1 NAME

cPanel::PublicAPI::WHM - Legacy interface for querying WHM.

NOTE: This module is provided for legacy purposes, L<cPanel::PublicAPI> should be used instead

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides legacy compatibility support between L<cPanel::PublicAPI> and Cpanel::Accounting (distributed with cPanel).
This should never be used unless there is a very good reason to use it (such as having a script that uses Cpanel::Accounting).

=head1 functions

=head2 C<simple_get_whmreq()>

This function makes a HTTP GET query to WHM, an equivalent function within L<cPanel::PublicAPI> is C<api_request()>.
This function uses two arrays to specify arguments to be passed to a specific URI.
This means that you would need to ensure that they both have the key/pair values in the same place in each array, f.ex:

  $argref = ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'];
  $argnameref = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3'];

would be be specifying:

  key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3

to be passed to the specified URI.

Arguments

=over

=item * $uri - The URI you to be queried.

=item * $argref - An array reference containing the values to be passed.

=item * $argnameref - An array reference containing the keys to be passed.

=item * $opts - An array reference containing strings like 'key1=value1' to be passed to the URI.

=back

This will return a scalar reference of the data returned by cpsrvd.

=head2 C<simple_post_whmreq()>

This function makes a HTTP POST query to WHM, an equivalent function within L<cPanel::PublicAPI> is C<api_request()>.
This function uses two arrays to specify arguments to be passed to a specific URI.
This means that you would need to ensure that they both have the key/pair values in the same place in each array, f.ex:

  $argref = ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'];
  $argnameref = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3'];

would be be specifying:

  key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3

to be passed to the specified URI.

Arguments

=over

=item * $uri - The URI you to be queried.

=item * $argref - An array reference containing the values to be passed.

=item * $argnameref - An array reference containing the keys to be passed.

=item * $opts - An array reference containing strings like 'key1=value1' to be passed to the URI.

=back

This will return a scalar containing the data returned by cpsrvd.

=head2 C<whmreq()>

This function is used to querying WHM with either GET or POST data.

=over

=item * $uri - The URI to be queried.

=item * $method - The method of querying the URI (either GET or POST).

=item * $formdata - The data to be passed to the URI formatted as formdata (e.g. 'key1=value1&key2=value2').

=back

=head2 C<api1()>

This function is used to query cPanel's API1.  This will return the XML response from the XML API's cpanel call.

=over

=item * $user - The user to execute an API call for.

=item * $module - The module of the API call to be executed.

=item * $func - The name of the API call to be executed.

=item * @params - An array containing the parameters for the API call.

=back

=head2 C<api2()>

This function is used to query cPanel's API1.  This will return the XML response from the XML API's cpanel call.

=over

=item * $user - The user to execute an API call for.

=item * $module - The module of the API call to be executed.

=item * $func - The name of the API call to be executed.

=item * %params - An hash containing the parameters for the API call.
