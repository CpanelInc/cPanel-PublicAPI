=head1 NAME

cPanel::PublicAPI::WHM::CachedVersion - Allows for lookups of remote versions of cPanel & WHM.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to lookup the version of a remote instance of cPanel & WHM based off of the contents of /var/cpanel/accounting/cache, if the server is not stored there, it will perform the version call.

/var/cpanel must exist in order for this to work, /var/cpanel/accounting and /var/cpanel/accounting/cache will be created if necessary.

=head1 cached_version()

This module consists of a single function - cPanel::PublicAPI::WHM::CachedVersion::cached_version().  It expects an already configured publicapi instance.

Syntax:

  my $pubapi = cPanel::PublicAPI::WHM::CachedVersion->new( 'host' => 'somehost', 'user' => 'someuser', ... );
  my $version = $pubapi->cached_version();

This will return a string containing the version of the cpanel/whm server being queried.
