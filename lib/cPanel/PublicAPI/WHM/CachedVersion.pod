This module consists of a single function - cPanel::PublicAPI::WHM::CachedVersion::cached_version().  It expects an already configured publicapi instance.

Syntax:

  my $pubapi = cPanel::PublicAPI::WHM::CachedVersion->new( 'host' => 'somehost', 'user' => 'someuser', ... );
  my $version = $pubapi->cached_version();

This will return a string containing the version of the cpanel/whm server being queried.
